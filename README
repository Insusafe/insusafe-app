# üßä InsuSafe: The Decentralized Safety Network for Life-Saving Insulin

## Smart Cooling, Verified Trust, Community-Powered.

InsuSafe is an intelligent system that solves the core problem of safe insulin storage. We combine a smart cooler with the **Hedera Hashgraph** to provide verifiable safety and an incentivized community safety net.

### üåü Project Status

## üí° The Problem & Our Solution

### **The Problem**
Insulin must be stored between **$2^{\circ}C$ and $8^{\circ}C$** to be effective. For millions of patients, simple coolers are unreliable, leading to **30% of insulin losses** and causing anxiety.

### **The InsuSafe Solution**
InsuSafe provides a three-part system for complete safety:

1.  **Precision Cooling:** A **Peltier system** actively maintains the safe temperature range.
2.  **Real-Time Monitoring:** A **Flutter mobile app** shows temperature and battery status instantly.
3.  **Decentralized Safety:** **Hedera** secures data and powers a fast, reliable community help network.

## ‚ú® Key Features & Hedera Innovation

Our integration with Hedera Hashgraph is the **competitive edge** of this project.

| Feature | Value Proposition | Hedera Integration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Immutable Storage Logs** | Every temperature reading is recorded immutably, guaranteeing the insulin's quality and preventing data tampering. | **Data Integrity:** Logs stored permanently on Hedera. |
| **The Safety Node** | Allows patients to securely and **anonymously** ask nearby InsuSafe users for emergency help. | **Community Network:** Hedera enables private, proximity-based patient connection. |
| **Incentivized Support** | Helpers are **instantly rewarded** for successful aid, ensuring a fast and reliable community response. | **Transactions:** Uses Hedera for fast, low-cost reward payouts. |
